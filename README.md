#Introduction
Overview
Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be _really_ easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we
use codeBin.

codeBin is the prettiest, easiest to use or share your code snippets..
Goals
1. Provide a simple interactive interface to users for sharing code or notes.
2. No login/SignUp needed.
Programming Language used
JavaScript or ES6 is used to build this web app.
Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is among the most powerful and flexible programming languages of the web. It
powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one.
Modules
Express.js
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust
set of features for web and mobile applications.
Mongoose
Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application
data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and
more, out of the box..
EJS
EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain
JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration
and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

Runtime Environment
Node.js
Node. js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for servers and
applications. It is built on a single-threaded, non-blocking event loop, the Google Chrome
V8 JavaScript engine, and a low-level I/O API. .
